# Question 1:
Implement a hash map from scratch that supports the following operations:< br / > 

put(key, value): Insert a (key, value) pair into the hash map. If the key already exists, update the value.< br / > 
get(key): Retrieve the value associated with the key. If the key does not exist, return -1.< br / > 
remove(key): Remove the key and its associated value from the hash map if the key exists.< br / > 


# Question 2:
Count the number of pairs in an array with a given sum using a hash map.< br / > 

Given an array of integers and a target sum, return the number of pairs of integers in the array that add up to the target sum.
